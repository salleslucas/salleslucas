# 👋 Hey, I'm Lucas Salles  

I’m a **Full Stack Software Developer at Globo**, passionate about building scalable, secure, and accessible digital solutions that truly impact people.  

🎓 Bachelor’s degree in **Computer Engineering** (Universidade Cândido Mendes) and currently pursuing a **Postgraduate degree in Full-Stack Development** at PUC-Rio.  
💻 Since 2021, I’ve been working on software development, creating portals and systems that support critical operations and improve the daily experience of thousands of collaborators.

## 🚀 What I Do  

At Globo, I’ve been part of strategic projects that combine **technology, accessibility, and security**:  

- **Movimenta Globo** → Recruitment portal with responsive interfaces, RESTful API integration, HTTP testing, and AI-assisted features.  
- **CSIRT** → External portal for incident analysis and response.  
- **SEGEM** → Strategic modules for key management, recording systems, security dashboards, and automation of rainfall monitoring.  

Previously, during my internship at **Beijaflore (TIM Brasil)**, I worked on the migration from a monolithic Ruby system to a modern architecture, building a new Vue.js front-end integrated with Kotlin APIs — enabling key contracts and projects such as *Spazio* and *Service Plan*.
